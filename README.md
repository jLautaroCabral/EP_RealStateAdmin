###### The initials EP in any repository stand for Educational Project. These are course projects and personal experiments for learning.  

Desktop application with MySQL database and receipt generation.
The application tries to respect the Model View Controller pattern.
The project doesn't have too many useful comments, I made it a long time ago and I won't add more comments or documentation because I don't plan to support it.
